This repository stores my codes for my research in computational research. 
All of the codes are specifically designed for a certain model under certain physical theories. 
Understanding them may require reading of papers which are usually indicated in the 'opening' comments.

Most code are not well-documented because I kept changing them in terms of the models, data structures, outputs, etc.
 
If you are interested in the methods used there, feel free to contact me: chengxiang.cn@gmail.com.
I am glad to discuss these methods, to offer help if I can, and to collaborate on interesting projects.

Thanks!
