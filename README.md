This repository includes some sample codes for my research in computational research. 
All of the codes are specifically designed for a certain model using certain computational algorithms. 

If you are interested in the methods used there, feel free to contact me: chengxiang.cn AT gmail.com.
I am glad to discuss these methods, to offer help if I can, and to collaborate on interesting projects.

Thanks!
